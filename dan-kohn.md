# In Memory of Dan Kohn

Dear community and friends,

I thought it might be a good idea for us all to gather our thoughts, memories and stories of Dan and what he meant to us in one place.

I first met Dan as I was bootstrapping CNCF and we were entering our crazy growth phase and needed to expand the team. While Dan and I didn't always agree on everything,
I had the pleasure of working with Dan on a daily basis the last few years cultivating CNCF and other LF projects. Dan was committed to building a global and diverse community, 
he always took the time to chat with community members all over the world and ensured that CNCF was using its resources to uplift the community.  We spent many hours on the road 
together away from family which can be tough for a father with young children. However, Dan always ensured that he would bring something back for the kids, or
better yet, find a way to bring them along to involve them in the community like handing our swag at our event in India earlier this year. After CNCF, Dan's next
project was establishing LF Public Health as a shared resource not just to fight COVID-19 but to combat future health crises. LFPH has already seen success and 
is bringing the spirit of open source to global health authorities. 

I will miss our fun conversations and plans... while I have lost a close friend, we have also lost a tireless champion for open source across the world.

I saw Dan for the first time at the keynote stage in Seattle during KubeCon'2016. These were the early days of the Kubernetes community and CNCF in general, but I was definitely impressed by the presentation made by this tall and loud gentleman.

A bit less than year later I've joined CNCF as a full-time staff member, and ability to work closely with Dan was one of the primary reasons why I made this decision. Despite the fact that I haven't reported to Dan directly, I felt his impact on the whole organization, on all of us, on an every single person within CNCF. He also was a kind and polite person who has helped me to steer in the woods of uncertainty at some points of my career.

Dan was a truly extraordinary person, and his impact on the whole open source industry is significant. I have a strong feeling that most of us (including myself) would not be there where we are now and would not do what we are doing now if we'd not met Dan.

Thank you, Dan.
